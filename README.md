# TankBuddy

Updated for BCC by Kahira - Bigglesworth NA

Tank Buddy BCC is based on work by Raespark, Kolthor, Kane

- Warriors: whenever taunt is resisted, or mocking blow fails, whenever you use Last Stand, Challenging Shout, Shield Wall, or Lifegiving Gem
- Druids: whenever growl (druids) is resisted, whenever you use challenging roar
- Paladins: whenever Righteous Defense is resisted.

Furthermore, it can remove any buffs desired, either always, or only in defensive stance/bear form/with Righteous Fury active.

To open the menu, just type `/tb` or `/tankbuddy.`
